This project is a simple ROS node that demonstrates how to send commands to ardrone_command (https://github.com/charlesrwest/ardrone_command).

The ardrone_application_node.cpp file has a main function that sends a bunch of commands to ardrone_command using service calls.  Similar code can be used with your node/application to control the AR Drone using ardrone_command.

It also has examples of using function callbacks to subscribe to the ROS topics published by ardrone_autonomy and print out information that is published on those topics.

This package requires ardrone_command to be installed and configured.  It can then be build by placing it in the catkin_ws/src directory and running catkin_make in the catkin_ws directory.
